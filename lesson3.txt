When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you want to share your work with other people, or if you are working from multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might not want to share your local work with other people. It might be private, or unfinished.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a copy of a repo on github that retains the history of the original repo,
    including a link to the originator of the repo. A clone is a copy of the repo.
    It can be either on github or local. Branches are copies of a commit that allow for
    separate work that won't interfere with the main trunk of the git tree.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If you were offline you could compare what was last pushed to the remote.
    You could fix and merge locally.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    You could use a different site, such as bitbucket.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    You could try things out and not worry that you're going to ruin the master version. 
    The benefit of master is that it's the clean version, the production version. The
    benefit of a separate branch is that a branch is a sandbox where you can play around
    with new ideas.
